# Function Literals

Function Literals will be compared by implementation and syntax in scala, c++, java, python, and golang.<br/> 
They are also known as anonymous functions or lambda expression.


The basic concept in functional programming is the ability to treat functions as first class citizens like values.<br/>
Therefore, functions can be;
- Assigned to a value
- Passed as a paramter
- Returned from a higher other function

**Task:**
1. To convert of a string array of urls from uppercase letters to lowercase letters.<br/>
2. Array traversing technique implemented will not include the traditional __*forloop*__ except for golang 
which has no alternative.<br/>
